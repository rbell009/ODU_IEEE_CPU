# ODU_IEEE_CPU
ODU IEEE Student Branch CPU Architecture, we are attempting to develop a CPU architecture that follows the ARM ISA. And aimming to run the RISC-OS operating system.

I've included the Arm Reference Manual in the project so y'all don't need to go looking for it.

I will attempt to update this as much as I can, but git and ALDEC don't mix well so I can't guarantee the most up to date project. Feel free to ask questions
